# The `settings` object

Every field is optional. Send **only what should differ** from the deployed defaults — the server
merges the rest in. An unrecognised value is rejected at submission with
`settings.<field>: "x" is not one of the options this bot offers`.

The MCP `tools/list` response advertises these same values, generated from the server's own menus,
so it is the authority if this file and the live schema ever disagree.

## Language and font

`sourceLang` is the spoken language. `auto` lets the transcriber detect it — safe, and the right
answer when the user has not said what the video is in.

**Font choice is a coverage decision before it is a style one.**

| Font | Covers | Bold |
|------|--------|------|
| `aljazeera` | Arabic only — breaks Urdu | yes |
| `thmanyah` | Arabic only — breaks Urdu and Persian | no |
| `noto` (Noto Naskh Arabic) | Arabic + both supplements — safe for `ar` `ur` `fa` | no |
| `almarai` | Same coverage as Noto, real bold | yes |
| `cairo` | Same coverage as Noto, real bold | yes |
| `dubai` | Arabic | no |
| `frutiger` | Arabic, commercially licensed | yes |
| `neosans` | Arabic, commercially licensed | no |

For `targetLang: "ur"` or `"fa"`, use `noto`, `almarai` or `cairo`. A glyph the font does not carry
is drawn as a box or a blank gap in the finished video, silently — nothing errors.

## Style

`preset` sets the overall look; `color` and `background` override parts of it.

- `clean` — white text, outlined
- `hormozi` — yellow on black, social-video style
- `cinematic` — heavy outline
- `youtube` — boxed
- `naskh` — classical, for Arabic

`size` percentages are relative to `medium`: `xsmall` 55%, `small` 70%, `medium` 100%, `large` 150%,
`xlarge` 200%.

`background`: `preset` keeps whatever the preset chose, `none` is outline only, `box` is translucent,
`solid` is opaque.

## Position

Nine-cell grid plus raised variants that lift captions clear of the player chrome social apps draw
over a video:

`bottom` `center` `top` · `bottomLeft` `bottomRight` · `middleLeft` `middleRight` · `topLeft`
`topRight` · `lowerThird` (18% up) · `upperThird` (18% down) · `lowerMiddle` (27% up) ·
`belowCentre` · `aboveBottom`

For vertical social video, `lowerThird` or `aboveBottom` usually reads better than `bottom`, which
can sit under the app's own UI.

## Line length

`chars` caps a caption line before it is split into another cue.

**`auto` is not a number.** It is resolved per video from the frame size and the font size the
captions are drawn at, and it only ever shortens — the ceiling is the 42-character broadcast norm.
Prefer it: a fixed `42` on a 9:16 video (which most uploads are) is too wide for the frame, and
libass *wraps* rather than clips, stacking every cue into two or three lines over the picture.
`auto` also enables a reading-rate cap that splits a line which would otherwise flash full-width for
half a second.

## Transcriber and translator

`stt` names which provider is tried **first**, not the only one — the rest follow as fallbacks, so an
outage rolls over instead of failing the job.

| `translator` | Model | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| `llama70b` | Llama 3.3 70B | Most accurate; the default |
| `scout` | Llama 4 Scout | Faster |
| `m2m100` | M2M100 1.2B | Literal, cheapest — no context prompting, so weakest on sentences |
| `riva` | NVIDIA Riva 4B | Arabic-tuned; needs the Worker's NVIDIA key |

## Fields that do nothing useful over MCP

- `review: "on"` — **rejected**. It pauses the run on a Telegram card to show the script first.
- `preview: "on"` — **rejected**. Same card, with a burned frame.
- `confirm` — accepted and ignored. It gates the Telegram settings card before a run starts; an MCP
  job has no card to show.
